### Requirements
To run the app successfully make sure that you are using the following.

Runtime:
* [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

Packages:
* [MimeKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit)
* [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit)
* [Pastel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pastel)
* [DotNetEnv](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetEnv/)
* [SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki)
* [Dapper](https://www.learndapper.com/)

Files:
* In your entry point directory, create a file named Credentials.env and add the environmental variables EMAIL and EMAIL_PASSWORD for sending emails, SMS_API_USERNAME and SMS_API_PASSWORD for sending SMS messages and CURRENCY_API_KEY for fetching currency data.

### Notes
* Keep in mind that some email providers require SMTP authentication for third party applications. This means that your regular password might not work when trying to send emails through this app. To fix this, access your email account and generate a third party app password and set it as the value for the EMAIL_PASSWORD variable.
  Alternatively contact one the contributors to use Team Salamanders SMTP credentials.

* This application uses the [46elks](https://46elks.se/) API for sending SMS messages and [currencyapi.com](https://currencyapi.com/) for fetching currency data. To access these API's you will have to get a subscription or ask Team Salamander for the API keys and passwords.

### Structure
In this application we have chosen to structure the code in the following way.
* Program.cs is the entry point of the program and is only used to start the application.
* The Ui class displays user options and is largely responsible for message output and formatting.
* The object classes: User, Account, Transfer, Loan and Currency, stores information that can be processed by the manager classes.
* The Manager classes: UserManager, AccountManager, TransferManager, LoanManager, CurrencyManager and Auth, processes the information of objects and sends the data to the Ui class and also handles database querying.
* The DB class initializes the database and created the database tables.
* The classes, EmailService and SmsService Handles the formatting and sending of email and sms messages respectively.
